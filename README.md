This was an interesting experience, I've built the project for scale, so when I'm done with my Data Visualization Certificate I can easily add those projects to the website and they won't break it. This website will take very little maintenance to work, which is good as I currently do not have mucht ime on my hands.

I'm very proud of this project, It's minimalistic and stylish at the same time. Most of all it's fully responsive.
One thing I regret is that IE doesn't support grid so the whole project looks absolutely horrific on IE, I regret that because I realised that too late.
Maybe if I would have found out sooner I could have made this page look ok on IE aswell. Next time.

This project taught me a lot about hosting, certificates and domain names. Did I pay a lot to get it? YES, but I think it was worth it. It shows my commitment in the best possible way.
