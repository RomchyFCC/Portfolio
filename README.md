This was an interesting experience, I've built the project for scale, so when I'm done with my Data Visualization Certificate I can easily add those projects to the website and they won't break it. This website will take very little maintenance to work, which is good as I currently do not have much time on my hands.

This project taught me a lot about hosting, certificates and domain names. Did I pay a lot to get it? YES, but I think it was worth it. It shows my commitment in the best possible way.
